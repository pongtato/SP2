Thief: As a thief, you have to go in and steal whatever you can, then escape WITHOUT DYING. As you may expect, the doors
are rigged to send an alarm to summon policemen if you leave without paying. Luckily, you can just steal guns and use them
... somehow. 

Stocker: StockER, not StockING. Rather boring job, actually. You'll just have to put stuff back on the shelves after
people take them off for a shift of... let's say, 3 minutes. Just makes sure that everything's filled... got it?

Guard: Guard the place from thieves, shoplifters, serial killers, yourself... the list goes on and on. Just about 
everyone hates this place, and it's up to you to defend it. A set number of enemies will spawn, and it's up to you to 
stop them!
